      <strong>HTML Basics:</strong>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
        HTML, <em>Hyper Text Markup Language </em> is comprised of:
      <ul>
        <li>Text content - ie what you see.</li>
        <li>Markup - the construction blocks of html that define what the text looks like.</li>
        <li>References to other documents (Links to video, and images).</li>
        <li>Links to <a href = "http://www.udacity.com" title= "Udacity homepage!">other pages</a>.</li>

      <strong> Overview of HTML Markup:</strong>
      </div>
      <p>
        HTML is comprised of tags which defines the behavior and appearance of a webpage.  Tags are structured as follows: <br>
      </p>
      &lt; name &gt;content &lt;/name&gt;. 
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>&lt; name &gt; - is called the opening tag.</li>
          <li>contents - is called the tag contents.</li>
          <li>&lt; /name &gt; - is called the closing tag.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        The set of tags is also referred too as an <em>Element.</em> It is important to remember that the behavior of a tag will <br>
        remain in effect until it is closed &lt;/&gt;!
        <u>Example elements found in this exercise</u>
        <ul>
          <li>&lt; b &gt;<b>Will make text bold</b> &lt;/b &gt; </li>
          <li>&lt; em &gt;<em>Will make text italic</em> &lt; /em &gt; </li>
          <li>&lt; a &gt;&lt;/a &gt; is an anchor tag.  An example of this tag in use is in the creation of a link to another webpage.
          That tag is constructed with the following syntax:  &lt;a href = "url"&gt; URL Plain text &lt;/a&gt;. In use it would look something like this:<br><br>
          <a href = "https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/100982870918349023509?cfem=1" title= "Udacity Introduction to Programming community homepage!">G+ Community Homepage!</a>
          </li> 
          <li>&lt;img src = "URL" alt = "alternate text"&gt; Will embed an image here.</li>
        </ul>
          Note: A closing tag is not needed for this element.  It is whats referred to as a Void Tag.

      <strong> Notes on Whitespace</strong>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
        There are two types of whitespace
        <ol>
          <li>In-line</li>
          <li>Block</li>
        </ol>
      <u> In-line Whitespace:</u> Ends a line by wrapping text to a new line. 
      <br>
      <br>
      <em> Examples of in-line elements are: </em>
      <ul>
        <li>a</li>
        <li>span</li>
        <li>br</li>
        <li>img</li>
        <li>strong</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <u> Block Whitespace:</u> Adds an invisible box around the text encapsulated by the tag 
      <br>
      <br>
      <em> Examples of in-line elements are: </em>
      <ul>
        <li>p</li>
        <li>div</li>
        <li>form</li>

      <strong> The Structure of an HTML Document: </strong>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      The bare bones markup of an HTML document looks like this...
        <p>
          &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt; <br>
          &lt;html&gt; <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt; head &gt; <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;title&gt; TITLE &lt;/title&gt;<br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt; /head&gt; <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt; body&gt;<br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;content&gt;the content (text, images, links, etc) is contained in the HTML body &lt;/content&gt; <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/body&gt; <br>

      <strong> Front End web development Overview</strong>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>
      Front end web development is visual.  A good conceptual construct of a website is like a house. There are three <br> components of this house:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>HTML</em>:  Acts as the structure like where the walls are placed or the location of the room </li>
        <li><em>CSS</em>: Acts as the style of the house like the color and texture of the walls or the type of decorations </li>
        <li><em>JavaScript</em>: Acts as the interactive components of a house like a remote control for the TV or a garage door opener</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      Web browsers have development tools that allow the user to view source code/styling and interactively (and temporarily)modify code on the fly.
      <br>

      <strong> Document Object Model (DOM)</strong>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>
      The Document Object Model is a tree like structure of a web-page.  It is a cross platform language convention for representing and interacting with objects.  The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure called a DOM Tree.  In HTML these objects are known as elements.

      <strong> Boxes, Grids, and Rules </strong>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      The architecture of a website is setup as a series of boxes that are aligned with a grid.  This allows the <br>developer to re-arrange the web-page to change the user experience of the site with relative ease.

      <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>
      Cascading means that the rules are applied no only to the elements they directly match <br>
      but also to all those child elements.  However, if the child element has multiple overlapping 
      <br> rules defined for it, the more specific rule takes effect.

      <strong>CSS Styling Laws</strong>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p> Styles can be defined in different places and are applied in the following order with definitions<br> further down the list overwriting previous definitions. The more specific rule is applied to every element. <br>A great example of how the styling laws work
      are how geographic and political boundaries are set up in the United States: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>National</em></li>
        <li><em>State</em></li>
        <li><em>County</em></li>
        <li><em>City</em></li>
        <li><em>Residence</em></li>

      <strong>Controlling HTML with CSS</strong>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p> In CSS, the element you wish to control is referred to as the <em>selector</em>.
      Each line within the selector is called a <br> <em>declaration</em>.  The text to the
      left of the ":" is the <em>property</em> - and the text to the right is called the <em>value</em>.<br>
      For example: </p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; p { <br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; color:white <br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br><br>
      Will set the color of all paragraph text to white.
      <br>
      <br>
      Class selectors apply styles to specific classes within the respective name defined in the HTML.
      <br>using .class-name
      <br>
      <br>
       You can include CSS in a web page by:
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Write CSS in the <em>head</em> of HTML</li>
        <li>Link your HTML to a separate CSS File (this is the preferred method)</li>
        <li>Write the styling in-line with your HTML (this is not ideal...<b>at all</b>)
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class = "concept">
      <div class = "concept-title">
      <strong>Code, Test, Refine (repeat)</strong>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p> There are a few steps to follow to become better at coding: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Look for Natural Blocks in web pages</li>
        <li>Look for repeated styles and syntax elements</li>
        <li>Write HTML code</li>
        <li>Apply Styles (from big to small)</li>
        <li>Fix Things</li>
      </ol>
      Developer tools in browsers such as Google Chrome allow programmers to make changes to code on the fly<br> without having to change the original source code.
